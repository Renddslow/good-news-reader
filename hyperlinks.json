Ultimately we see two themes play out. Throughout the Bible we see God calling a specific set of people out of their current cultural context to be priests – mediators of God's goodness, blessing, and grace – to the nations.</p><p>We see this call given to Adam and Eve, to the Israelites, then the Levites (a specific tribe within Israel), and then to a specific family within the Levites. Each call bore with it the idea that all humans were meant to carry on God's goodness and blessing to the world. That was the call to Israel in Exodus 19. Peter picks up this call in 1 Peter 2, calling the whole Christian community a kingdom of priests just like Israel was supposed to be.</p><p>When we see priest in the Bible, we also think about specially anointed (Hebrew: <em>meshiakh</em> or Messiah) person who goes between the people and YHWH and is able to forgive sins.</p><p>In the New Testament we discover that all of these specially anointed people were a template for the work of grace and salvation Jesus was ultimately bringing.</p>",

Instead of treating them with hospitality and openness, he chooses the way of scarcity. In fact, his statement to the elders of Moab sounds eerily familiar to the Pharaoh of Exodus 1. Balak hires a shaman named Balaam to curse the Israelites. When that fails, he tries to send women into the camp to entice men not only to sexual immorality, but to forsake YHWH in favor of Moabite gods.</p><p>It is through YHWH's own faithfulness against the powers of Balaam and the zeal and faithfulness of Phinehas the young priest that ultimately win the day and thwart Balak's schemes.</p>",
