The end is near.

This final movement is o so short. The shortest of all the movements so far we are shown a vision of heavenly temple and city that mirrors the temple vision of Ezekiel 40-48. We are reminded too of the intricacy and intentionality of the design of the tabernacle throughout the latter half of Exodus. 

We are shown that this heavenly city is an image of heaven and earth reuniting and the world is restored to look a lot like the garden of Eden. But now we find ourselves in a bustling city, filled with humans of all nations, ethnicities, races, and languages.

The final words of the movement are directed at John in a particular moment, but are also a reflection on the core message of the entire book of Revelation: "Worship God."

Given that this is the shortest movement, I encourage you to read it once daily, and reflect on the hope of the resurrection and the reuniting of heaven and earth. Read this last movement and the concluding epilogue like a prayer.
