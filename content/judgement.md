**Movement 2** of Revelation is the longest movement of the book. 
Because of that, we'll take it slowly over the course of the next 
two weeks. This might feel odd, especially if you're the achiever 
type who likes to collect badges.

But remember: the Bible is meant to be literature for a 
lifetime. Over these next to two weeks, find opportunities to 
intentionally engage with each reading, moving threw it like 
you're savoring it. If you're a fast reader, loop back over what 
we've read so far, paying attention to the ways each movement 
flows into one another.

This movement picks up with John's vision continuing. Remember, 
each time a new movement begins, he signals it with the phrase "in 
the Spirit." It works like a reminder to us that the Holy Spirit 
is working through him to see this vision, but also to help us pay 
attention as we're about to begin a new thought.

This new thought begins with all of heaven worshipping God the 
Father. This is a scene we've seen before in Isaiah 6. But it's 
immediately followed up by the same style of worship being 
attributed to Jesus. We're seeing a confirmation that Jesus is who 
we thought he was. He's truly divine, co-equal and co-eternal with 
the Father and the Holy Spirit. 

After four strange horsemen are introduced, we are introduced to the 
martyrs. These are men and women who've lost their lives for their
allegiance to Jesus. They cry out to God, "How long will you wait to judge the world and avenge our blood?" The following images, which are themselves three mini-movements which reflect the plagues on Egypt, answer the questions of the martyrs.
