**Movement 3** is like an intense action film. It comes out of the gate swinging and doesn't let up until the hero arrives and begins to set things to rights. 

It is common to think about the return of Jesus as the "day of the Lord." It's this moment when God confronts evil, often turning the ordered universe into chaos around the project of evil. Just as they have sown disorder into God's good world, God allows that disorder to fall back on their heads (literally! Recall Revelation 16:21).

The thing is, we sort of already saw the Day of the Lord. Actually, we saw it three times. Once when the seals were opened, once when the trumpets were sounded, and then finally when the bowls were poured out. We begin this movement with a Day of the Lord against Babylon in classic prophetic fashion.

But then movement 3 does something different from every other instance of the Day of the Lord throughout the Bible. It offers us a **coda**. A coda brings a musical piece – often one that has several repeated patterns or themes – to a close. And so too does movement 3 bring not only the pattern of the Day of the Lord to a close, but it begins the close of the whole of Scripture.

_Note that this movement is far shorter than movement 2, however many of the hyperlinks are lengthier._
