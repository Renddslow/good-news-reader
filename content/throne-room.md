John's prologue to the book of Revelation is unusual. It feels out
of step with the rest of the book. For that reason, a lot of
people tend to approach them as if they are two entirely different
messages.

You're got the **prologue** in which God's Spirit
instructs John to write to seven churches scattered throughout
modern-day Turkey. There are seven letters, but really, there is
just one message: remain faithful to Jesus.

The remaining four movements track this incredible cosmic journey
as we see God confront and deal with human evil. We see glimpses
of the past, glimpses of the present, and glimpses of the future.

And it's these glimpses of the future that often make the rest of
Revelation stand out from its prologue. But remember, just like
John writes seven letters that all have the same message, the book
of Revelation is a unified message: remain faithful to Jesus.

In the **first movement** we'll get our bearings by remembering
who the main character of this book really is. It's not some
antichrist, beast, or dragon. It's not even the saints, the
martyrs, or the overcomers. The book of Revelation is an act of
worship of the Triune God and an invitation to join in that worship.
