The book of Revelation belongs to a style of Biblical literature
referred to as apocalyptic. Apocalyptic occupies a rather
different space than its fellow styles and genres. Where Biblical
narrative tends to be sparse on detail and descriptions, focusing
on character dramas primarily through speech, apocalyptic
describes the cosmos in terms more familiar to Biblical poetry.

For this reason, Revelation (and other apocalyptic works throughout
Scripture) tends to use elevated and heightened language to
describe events. It attempts to reveal the behind-the-scenes drama
of the cosmos through elaborate imagery, metaphor, and parallelism.

and genre works in the Bible.
