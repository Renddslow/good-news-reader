    <p>Hey {{firstName}},</p>
    <p>
      Each week we’ve released a game as a way to practice the Hebrew and Greek words you’ve
      collected during your readings.
    </p>
    <p>
      This week’s game is “Not Like the Others.” Test your knowledge of all the Hebrew and Greek
      words you’ve collected so far. The real question is which word in the list is not like the
      others? Take your time as you try to draw each word to mind and try to catch 5 words that are
      not like the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you haven’t had a chance to try the other games, you can go back and play them now. Test
      your knowledge of the word “life” by swimming to the surface and collecting fish along the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may try something a little harder: distinguishing between words that mean “life” and
      “love” and any other words you've collected since then (don’t worry, there are hints if you
      need a little help).
    </p>
    <p>Each game will be chosen at random when you click a "Practice" button on the main page.</p>
    <p>
      We believe that learning some of the words in the Bible’s original languages helps us
      understand the Biblical authors’ original intent and the context where they lived. Learning
      words in Hebrew and Greek can provide a window into a different time and place, one where we
      are foreigners and have a lot of learning to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Practicing these words can open your eyes and you will begin to notice patterns across the
      whole of the Biblical story. We pray that your heart will be transformed during your learning.
      Keep your eyes peeled for more games, and in a few weeks for an email that has a short survey
      about your thoughts on the Good News Reader. Thanks for joining us and trying out a new way of
      learning.
