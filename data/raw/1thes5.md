{1} Now as to the periods and times, brothers and sisters, you have no need of anything to be written to you. {2} For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord is coming just like a thief in the night. {3} While they are saying, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction will come upon them like labor pains upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. {4} But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness, so that the day would overtake you like a thief; {5} for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness; {6} so then, let’s not sleep as others do, but let’s be alert and sober. {7} For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are drunk, get drunk at night. {8} But since we are of the day, let’s be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation. {9} For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, {10} who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him. {11} Therefore, encourage one another and build one another up, just as you also are doing.
