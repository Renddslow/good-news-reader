They are handed over to you. {3} Every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; I have given everything to you, as I gave the green plant. {4} But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its [[dam|blood]]. {5} I certainly will require your [[dam|lifeblood]]; from every animal I will require it. And from every person, from every man as his brother I will require the life of a person.

{6} Whoever sheds human [[dam|blood]],
\indent(2) By man his [[dam|blood]] shall be shed,
For in the image of God
\indent(2) He made mankind.
{7} As for you, be fruitful and multiply;
\indent(2) Populate the earth abundantly and multiply in it.”
