{1} While Israel remained at Shittim, the people began to commit 
infidelity with the daughters of Moab. {2} For they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods. {3} So Israel became followers of Baal of Peor, and YHWH was angry with Israel. {4} And YHWH said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before YHWH, so that the fierce anger of YHWH may turn away from Israel.” {5} So Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Each of you kill his men who have become followers of Baal of Peor.”

{6} Then behold, one of the sons of Israel came and brought to his relatives a Midianite woman, in the sight of Moses and in the sight of the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, while they were weeping at the entrance of the tent of meeting. {7} When Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation and took a spear in his hand, {8} and he went after the man of Israel into the inner room of the tent and pierced both of them, the man of Israel and the woman, through the abdomen. So the plague on the sons of Israel was brought to a halt. {9} But those who died from the plague were twenty-four thousand in number.
