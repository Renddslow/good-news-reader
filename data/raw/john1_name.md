{1} In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. {2} He was in the beginning with God. {3} All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not even one thing came into being that has come into being. {4} In Him was [[zoe|life]], and the [[zoe|life]] was the Light of mankind. {5} And the Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not grasp it.

{6} A man came, one sent from God, and his [[onoma|name]] was John. {7} He came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through him. {8} He was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light.

{9} This was the true Light that, coming into the world, enlightens every person. {10} He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, and yet the world did not know Him. {11} He came to His own, and His own people did not accept Him. {12} But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His [[onoma|name]], {13} who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of a man, but of God.

{14} And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us; and we saw His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. {15} John testified about Him and called out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, ‘He who is coming after me has proved to be my superior, because He existed before me.’” {16} For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace. {17} For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ. {18} No one has seen God at any time; God the only Son, who is in the arms of the Father, He has explained Him.
