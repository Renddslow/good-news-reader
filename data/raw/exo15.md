{1} Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the Lord, saying:

---!q
“I will sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted;
The horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea.
{2} The Lord is my strength and song,
\indent(2) And He has become my salvation;
This is my God, and I will praise Him;
\indent(2) My father’s God, and I will exalt Him.
{3} The Lord is a warrior;
\indent(2) The Lord is His name.
{4} Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has thrown into the sea;
\indent(2) And the choicest of his officers are drowned in the Red Sea.
{5} The waters cover them;
\indent(2) They went down into the depths like a stone.
{6} Your right hand, Lord, is majestic in power;
\indent(2) Your right hand, Lord, destroys the enemy.
{7} And in the greatness of Your excellence You overthrow those who rise up against You;
\indent(2) You send out Your burning anger, and it consumes them like chaff.
{8} At the blast of Your nostrils the waters were piled up,
\indent(2) The flowing waters stood up like a heap;
\indent(2) The depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.
{9} The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoils;
\indent(2) I shall be satisfied against them;
\indent(2) I will draw my sword, my hand will destroy them.’
{10} You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them;
\indent(2) They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
{11} Who is like You among the gods, YHWH?
\indent(2) Who is like You, majestic in holiness,
\indent(2) Awesome in praises, working wonders?
{12} You reached out with Your right hand,
\indent(2) The earth swallowed them.
{13} In Your faithfulness You have led the people whom You have redeemed;
\indent(2) In Your strength You have guided them to Your holy habitation.
{14} The peoples have heard, they tremble;
\indent(2) Anguish has gripped the inhabitants of Philistia.
{15} Then the chiefs of Edom were terrified;
\indent(2) The leaders of Moab, trembling grips them;
All the inhabitants of Canaan have despaired.
\indent(2) {16} Terror and dread fall upon them;
\indent(2) By the greatness of Your arm they are motionless as stone,
Until Your people pass over, Lord,
\indent(2) Until the people pass over whom You have purchased.
{17} You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance,
\indent(2) The place, Lord, which You have made as Your dwelling,
The sanctuary, Lord, which Your hands have established.
\indent(2) {18} The Lord shall reign forever and ever.”
