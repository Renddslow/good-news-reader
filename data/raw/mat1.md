{1} The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham:

{2} Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers. {3} Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez fathered Hezron, and Hezron fathered Ram. {4} Ram fathered Amminadab, Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon. {5} Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse. {6} Jesse fathered David the king.

David fathered Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah. {7} Solomon fathered Rehoboam, Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa. {8} Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, and Joram fathered Uzziah. {9} Uzziah fathered Jotham, Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah. {10} Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, Manasseh fathered Amon, and Amon fathered Josiah. {11} Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.

{12} After the deportation to Babylon: Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel. {13} Zerubbabel fathered Abihud, Abihud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor. {14} Azor fathered Zadok, Zadok fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud. {15} Eliud fathered Eleazar, Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob. {16} Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called the Messiah.

{17} So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations.

{18} Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah was as follows: when His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit. {19} And her husband Joseph, since he was a righteous man and did not want to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly. {20} But when he had thought this over, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. {21} She will give birth to a Son; and you shall [[onoma|name]] Him Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.” {22} Now all this took place so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled: {23} “Behold, the virgin will conceive and give birth to a Son, and they shall [[onoma|name]] Him Immanuel,” which translated means, “God with us.” {24} And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took Mary as his wife, {25} but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he [[onoma|named]] Him Jesus.
