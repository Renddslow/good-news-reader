{1} Listen to Me, you islands,
\indent(2) And pay attention, you peoples from afar.
The Lord called Me from the womb;
\indent(2) From the body of My mother He named Me.
{2} He has made My mouth like a sharp sword,
\indent(2) In the shadow of His hand He has concealed Me;
And He has also made Me a sharpened arrow,
\indent(2) He has hidden Me in His quiver.
{3} He said to Me, “You are My Servant, Israel,
\indent(2) In whom I will show My glory.”
{4} But I said, “I have labored in vain,
\indent(2) I have spent My strength for nothing and futility;
Nevertheless, the justice due to Me is with the Lord,
\indent(2) And My reward is with My God.”
