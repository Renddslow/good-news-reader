{21} Then the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered and spoke to the heads of the families of Israel. {22} “The Mighty One, God, YHWH, the Mighty One, God, YHWH! He knows, and may Israel itself know. If it was in rebellion, or if in an unfaithful act against YHWH, do not save us this day! {23} If we have built us an altar to turn away from following YHWH, or if to offer a burnt offering or grain offering on it, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings on it, may YHWH Himself demand it. {24} But truly we have done this out of concern, for a reason, saying, ‘In time to come your sons may say to our sons, “What have you to do with YHWH, the God of Israel? {25} For YHWH has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you sons of Reuben and sons of Gad; you have no portion in YHWH.” So your sons may make our sons stop fearing YHWH.’

{26} “Therefore we said, ‘Let’s build an altar, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice; {27} rather, it shall be [[eid|a witness]] between us and you and between our generations after us, that we are to perform the service of YHWH before Him with our burnt offerings, our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings, so that your sons will not say to our sons in time to come, “You have no portion in YHWH.”’ {28} Therefore we said, ‘It shall also come about if they say this to us or to our generations in time to come, then we shall say, “See the copy of the altar of YHWH which our fathers made, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice; rather, it is [[eid|a witness]] between us and you.”’ {29} Far be it from us that we should rebel against YHWH and turn away from following YHWH this day, by building an altar for burnt offering, for grain offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of YHWH our God which is before His tabernacle.”
