{1} Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, {2} make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. {3} Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility consider one another as more important than yourselves; {4} do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others. {5} Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, {6} who, as He already existed in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, {7} but emptied Himself by taking the form of a bond-servant and being born in the likeness of men. {8} And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death: death on a cross. {9} For this reason also God highly exalted Him, and bestowed on Him the [[onoma|name]] which is above every [[onoma|name]], {10} so that at the [[onoma|name]] of Jesus every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, {11} and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
