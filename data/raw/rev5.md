{1} I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a scroll
written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals. {2} And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?” {3} And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it. {4} Then I began to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. {5} And one of the elders said to me, “Stop weeping; behold, the [[lion-judah|Lion]] that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome so as to be able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”

{6} And I saw between the throne (with the four living creatures) and the elders a Lamb standing, [[passover-lamb|as if slaughtered]], having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. {7} And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. {8} When He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. {9} And they sang a new song, saying,

“Worthy are You to take the scroll and to break its seals; for You were slaughtered, and You purchased people for God with Your blood from every tribe, language, people, and nation.

---!q
{10} You have made them into a [[royal-priests|kingdom and priests]] to our God, and they will reign upon the earth.”

{11} Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands, {12} saying with a loud voice,

---!q
“Worthy is the Lamb that was slaughtered to receive power, wealth, wisdom, might, honor, glory, and blessing.”

---!p
{13} And I heard every created thing which is in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, or on the sea, and all the things in them, saying,

---!q
“To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion forever and ever.”

---!p
{14} And the four living creatures were saying, “Amen.” And the elders fell down and worshiped.
