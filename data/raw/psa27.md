{1} **A Psalm of David.**
The Lord is my light and my salvation;
\indent(2) Whom should I fear?
The Lord is the defense of my [[chay|life]];
\indent(2) Whom should I dread?
{2} When evildoers came upon me to devour my flesh,
\indent(2) My adversaries and my enemies, they stumbled and fell.
{3} If an army encamps against me,
\indent(2) My heart will not fear;
If war arises against me,
\indent(2) In spite of this I am confident.

{4} One thing I have asked from the Lord, that I shall seek:
\indent(2) That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my [[chay|life]],
To behold the beauty of the Lord
\indent(2) And to meditate in His temple.
{5} For on the day of trouble He will conceal me in His tabernacle;
\indent(2) He will hide me in the secret place of His tent;
He will lift me up on a rock.
\indent(2) {6} And now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me,
And I will offer sacrifices in His tent with shouts of joy;
\indent(2) I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the Lord.

---!q
{7} Hear, Lord, when I cry with my voice,
\indent(2) And be gracious to me and answer me.
{8} When You said, “Seek My face,” my heart said to You,
\indent(2) “I shall seek Your face, Lord.”
{9} Do not hide Your face from me,
\indent(2) Do not turn Your servant away in anger;
You have been my help;
\indent(2) Do not abandon me nor forsake me,
\indent(2) God of my salvation!
{10} For my father and my mother have forsaken me,
\indent(2) But the Lord will take me up.

---!q
{11} Teach me Your way, Lord,
\indent(2) And lead me on a level path
\indent(2) Because of my enemies.
{12} Do not turn me over to the desire of my enemies,
\indent(2) For false witnesses have risen against me,
\indent(2) And the violent witness.
{13} I certainly believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord
\indent(2) In the land of the [[chay|living]].
{14} Wait for the Lord;
\indent(2) Be strong and let your heart take courage;
\indent(2) Yes, wait for the Lord.
