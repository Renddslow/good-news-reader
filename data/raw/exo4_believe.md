{1} Then Moses said, “What if they will not [[aman|believe]] me or listen to what I say? For they may say, ‘YHWH has not appeared to you.’” {2} YHWH said to him, “What is that in your hand?” And he said, “A staff.” {3} Then He said, “Throw it on the ground.” So he threw it on the ground, and it turned into a serpent; and Moses fled from it. {4} But YHWH said to Moses, “Reach out with your hand and grasp it by its tail”—so he reached out with his hand and caught it, and it turned into a staff in his hand— {5} “so that they may [[aman|believe]] that YHWH, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”

{6} YHWH furthermore said to him, “Now put your hand inside the fold of your robe.” So he put his hand inside the fold, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous like snow. {7} Then He said, “Put your hand inside the fold of your robe again.” So he put his hand into the fold again, and when he took it out of the fold, behold, it was restored like the rest of his flesh. {8} “So if they will not [[aman|believe]] you nor pay attention to the evidence of the first sign, they may [[aman|believe]] the evidence of the last sign. {9} But if they will not [[aman|believe]] even these two signs nor pay attention to what you say, then you shall take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water which you take from the Nile will turn into blood on the dry ground.”

{10} Then Moses said to YHWH, “Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither recently nor in time past, nor since You have spoken to Your servant; for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.” {11} But YHWH said to him, “Who has made the human mouth? Or who makes anyone unable to speak or deaf, or able to see or blind? Is it not I, YHWH? {12} Now then go, and I Myself will be with your mouth, and instruct you in what you are to say.” {13} But he said, “Please, Lord, now send the message by whomever You will.”
