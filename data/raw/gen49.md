{8} “Judah, your brothers will praise you;
\indent(2) your hand will be on the neck of your enemies;
\indent(2) your father’s sons will bow down to you.
{9} Judah is a lion’s cub;
\indent(2) From the prey, my son, you have gone up.
He crouches, he lies down as a lion,
\indent(2) And as a lion, who dares to stir him up?
{10} The scepter will not depart from Judah,
\indent(2) Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet,
Until Shiloh comes,
\indent(2) And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.
{11} He ties his foal to the vine,
\indent(2) And his donkey’s colt to the choice vine;
He washes his garments in wine,
\indent(2) And his robes in the blood of grapes.
{12} His eyes are dull from wine,
\indent(2) And his teeth white from milk.
