{7} A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.” {8} For His disciples had gone away to the city to buy food. {9} So the Samaritan woman said to Him, “How is it that You, though You are a Jew, are asking me for a drink, though I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.) {10} Jesus replied to her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.” {11} She said to Him, “Sir, You have no bucket and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water? {12} You are not greater than our father Jacob, are You, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, and his sons and his cattle?” {13} Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again; {14} but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never be thirsty; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.”
