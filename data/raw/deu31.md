{19} “Now write down this song and teach it to the Israelites and have them sing it, so that it may be a [[|eid|witness]] for me against them. {20} When I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, the land I promised on oath to their ancestors, and when they eat their fill and thrive, they will turn to other gods and worship them, rejecting me and breaking my covenant. {21} And when many disasters and calamities come on them, this song will [[eid|testify]] against them, because it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what they are disposed to do, even before I bring them into the land I promised them on oath.” {22} So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites.

{24} After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end, {25} he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of YHWH: {26} “Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of YHWH your God. There it will remain as a [[eid|witness]] against you. {27} For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against YHWH while I am still [[chay|alive]] and with you, how much more will you rebel after I die! {28} Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials, so that I can speak these words in their hearing and [[ud|call]] the heavens and the earth to testify against them. {29} For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall on you because you will do evil in the sight of YHWH and arouse his anger by what your hands have made.”
