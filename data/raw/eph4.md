{1} As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. {2} Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in [[agape|love]]. {3} Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. {4} There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; {5} one Lord, one faith, one baptism; {6} one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.

{7} But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. {8} This is why it says:

“When he ascended on high,
\indent(2) he took many captives
\indent(2) and gave gifts to his people.”

{9} (What does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions? {10} He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.) {11} So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, {12} to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up {13} until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.

{14} Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. {15} Instead, speaking the truth in [[agape|love]], we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. {16} From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in [[agape|love]], as each part does its work.

{17} So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. {18} They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the [[zoe|life]] of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. {19} Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed.
