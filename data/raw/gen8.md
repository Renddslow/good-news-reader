{13} Now it came about in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first of the month, that the water was dried up from the earth. Then Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground had dried up. {14} And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry. {15} Then God spoke to Noah, saying, {16} “Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons’ wives with you. {17} Bring out with you every [[chay|living thing]] of all flesh that is with you, birds and animals and every crawling thing that crawls on the earth, that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.” {18} So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him. {19} Every animal, every crawling thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by their families from the ark.

{22} While the earth remains,
Seedtime and harvest,
Cold and heat,
Summer and winter,
And day and night
Shall not cease.”
