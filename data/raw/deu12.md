{1} â€œThese are the statutes and the judgments which you shall carefully follow in the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess as long as you [[chayyim|live]] on the earth. {2} You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations whom you are going to dispossess serve their gods, on the high mountains, on the hills, and under every leafy tree. {3} And you shall tear down their altars and smash their memorial stones to pieces, and burn their Asherim in the fire, and cut to pieces the carved images of their gods; and you shall eliminate their [[shem|name]] from that place. {4} You shall not act this way toward the Lord your God. {5} But you shall seek the Lord at the place which the Lord your God will choose from all your tribes, to establish His [[shem|name]] there for His dwelling, and you shall come there. {6} You shall bring there your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the contribution of your hand, your vowed offerings, your voluntary offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock. {7} There you and your households shall eat before the Lord your God, and rejoice in all your undertakings in which the Lord your God has blessed you.
