{8} Now Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.” While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.

---!p
{9} Then YHWH said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?”

---!p
“I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”

---!p
{10} YHWH said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground. {11} Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. {12} When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.” {13} Cain said to YHWH, “My punishment is too great to endure! {14} Behold, You have driven me this day from the face of the ground; and I will be hidden from Your face, and I will be a wanderer and a drifter on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” {15} So YHWH said to him, “Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him seven times as much.” And YHWH placed a mark on Cain, so that no one finding him would kill him.

{16} Then Cain left the presence of YHWH, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

{17} Cain had relations with his wife and she conceived, and gave birth to Enoch; and Cain built a city, and [[shem|named]] the city Enoch, after the [[shem|name]] of his son. {18} Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech. {19} Lamech took two wives for himself: the [[shem|name]] of the one was Adah, and the [[shem|name]] of the other, Zillah. {20} Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and have livestock. {21} His brother’s [[shem|name]] was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and flute. {22} As for Zillah, she also gave birth to Tubal-cain, the forger of all implements of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.

{23} Lamech said to his wives,

“Adah and Zillah,
Listen to my voice,
\indent(2) You wives of Lamech,
\indent(2) Pay attention to my words,
For I have killed a man for wounding me;
\indent(2) And a boy for striking me!
{24} If Cain is avenged seven times,
\indent(2) Then Lamech seventy-seven times!”

{25} Adam had relations with his wife again; and she gave birth to a son, and [[shem|named]] him Seth, for, she said, “God has appointed me another child in place of Abel, because Cain killed him.” {26} To Seth also a son was born; and he [[shem|named]] him Enosh. Then people began to call upon the [[shem|name]] of YHWH.
