{55} Now the chief priests and the entire Council were trying to obtain testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, and they were not finding any. {56} For many people were giving false testimony against Him, and so their testimonies were not consistent. {57} And then some stood up and began giving false testimony against Him, saying, {58} “We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that was made by hands, and in three days I will build another, made without hands.’” {59} And not even in this respect was their testimony consistent. {60} And then the high priest stood up and came forward and questioned Jesus, saying, “Do You not offer any answer for what these men are testifying against You?” {61} But He kept silent and did not offer any answer. Again the high priest was questioning Him, and *said to Him, “Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” {62} And Jesus said, “I am; and you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.” {63} Tearing his clothes, the high priest said, “What further need do we have of witnesses? {64} You have heard the blasphemy; how does it seem to you?” And they all condemned Him as deserving of death.
