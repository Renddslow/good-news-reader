{1} Blessed is the person 
---!q2
who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
---!q1
Nor stand in the path of sinners,
---!q2
Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!
---!q1
{2} But his delight is in the Law of the Lord,
---!q2
And on His Law he meditates day and night.
---!q1
{3} He will be like a tree planted by streams of water,
---!q2
Which yields its fruit in its season,
---!q1
And its leaf does not wither;
---!q2
And in whatever he does, he prospers.

{4} The wicked are not so,
---!q2
But they are like chaff which the wind blows away.
---!q1
{5} Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
---!q2
Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
---!q1
{6} For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,
---!q2
But the way of the wicked will perish.
