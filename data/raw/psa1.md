{1} Blessed is the person
\indent(2) who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
Nor stand in the path of sinners,
\indent(2) Nor sit in the seat of scoffers!
{2} But his delight is in the torah of YHWH,
\indent(2) And on His torah he meditates day and night.
{3} He will be like a tree planted by streams of water,
\indent(2) Which yields its fruit in its season,
And its leaf does not wither;
\indent(2) And in whatever he does, he prospers.

{4} The wicked are not so,
\indent(2) But they are like chaff which the wind blows away.
{5} Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
\indent(2) Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
{6} For YHWH knows the way of the righteous,
\indent(2) But the way of the wicked will perish.
