{25} The ships of Tarshish were the carriers for your merchandise.

And you were filled and were very glorious
In the heart of the seas.

{26} “Your rowers have brought you
Into great waters;
The east wind has broken you
In the heart of the seas.
{27} Your wealth, your wares, your merchandise,
Your seamen and your sailors,
Your repairers of leaks, your dealers in merchandise,
And all your men of war who are in you,
With all your contingent that is in your midst,
Will fall into the heart of the seas
On the day of your overthrow.
{28} At the sound of the cry of your sailors,
The pasture lands will shake.
{29} All who handle the oar,
The seamen and all the sailors of the sea
Will come down from their ships;
They will stand on the land,
{30} And they will make their voice heard over you
And cry out bitterly.
They will throw dust on their heads,
They will wallow in ashes.
{31} Also they will shave themselves bald for you
And put on sackcloth;
And they will weep for you in bitterness of soul
With bitter mourning.
{32} Moreover, in their wailing they will take up a song of mourning for you
And sing a song of mourning over you:
‘Who is like Tyre,
Like her who is silent in the midst of the sea?
{33} When your merchandise went out from the seas,
You satisfied many peoples;
With the abundance of your wealth and your merchandise
You enriched the kings of the earth.
{34} Now that you are broken by the seas
In the depths of the waters,
Your merchandise and all your company
Have fallen in the midst of you.
{35} All the inhabitants of the coastlands
Are appalled at you,
And their kings are horribly afraid;
They have a troubled look.
{36} The merchants among the peoples hiss at you;
You have become terrified
And you will cease to be forever.’”’”
