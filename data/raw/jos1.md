{7} Only be strong and very courageous; be careful to do according 
to all the _torah_ which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn 
from it to the right or to the left, so that you may achieve 
success wherever you go. {8} This Book of the _torah_ shall not 
depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will achieve success.
