{1} In the year of King Uzziah’s death I saw the Lord sitting on a
throne, lofty and exalted, with the train of His robe filling the temple. {2} Seraphim were standing above Him, each having six wings: with two each covered his face, and with two each covered his feet, and with two each flew. {3} And one called out to another and said,

<poem>
---!q
“Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of armies.
---!q
The whole earth is full of His glory.”
</poem>

---!p
{4} And the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out, while the temple was filling with smoke. {5} Then I said,

<poem>
---!q
“Woe to me, for I am ruined!
---!q
Because I am a man of unclean lips,
---!q
And I live among a people of unclean lips;
---!q
For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of armies.”
</poem>

---!p
{6} Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with tongs. {7} He touched my mouth with it and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your guilt is taken away and atonement is made for your sin.”

{8} Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?” Then I said, “Here am I. Send me!” {9} And He said, “Go, and tell this people:

<poem>
---!q
‘Keep on listening, but do not understand;
---!q
And keep on looking, but do not gain knowledge.’
---!q
{10} Make the hearts of this people insensitive,
---!q
Their ears dull,
---!q
And their eyes blind,
---!q
So that they will not see with their eyes,
---!q
Hear with their ears,
---!q
Understand with their hearts,
---!q
And return and be healed.”
</poem>

---!p
{11} Then I said, “Lord, how long?” And He answered,

<poem>
---!q
“Until cities are devastated and without inhabitant,
---!q
Houses are without people
---!q
And the land is utterly desolate,
---!q
{12} The Lord has completely removed people,
---!q
And there are many forsaken places in the midst of the land.
---!q
{13} Yet there will still be a tenth portion in it,
---!q
And it will again be subject to burning,
---!q
Like a terebinth or an oak
---!q
Whose stump remains when it is cut down.
---!q
The holy seed is its stump.”
</poem>
