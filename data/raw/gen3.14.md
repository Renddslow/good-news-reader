{14} Then the Lord God said to the serpent,

“Because you have done this,
Cursed are you more than all the livestock,
\indent(2) And more than any animal of the field;
On your belly you shall go,
\indent(2) And dust you shall eat
\indent(2) All the days of your life;
{15} And I will make enemies
\indent(2) Of you and the woman,
\indent(2) And of your offspring and her Descendant;
He shall bruise you on the head,
\indent(2) And you shall bruise Him on the heel.”

{16} To the woman He said,

“I will greatly multiply
\indent(2) Your pain in childbirth,
\indent(2) In pain you shall deliver children;
Yet your desire will be for your husband,
\indent(2) And he shall rule over you.”
