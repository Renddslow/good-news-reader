{13} I direct you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, {14} that you keep the commandment without fault or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, {15} which He will bring about at the proper timeâ€”He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, {16} who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal dominion! Amen.
