{18} Then Moses said, “Now show me your glory.”

{19} And YHWH said, “I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my [[shem|name]], YHWH, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. {20} But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.”

{21} Then YHWH said, “There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock. {22} When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by. {23} Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen.”

{1} YHWH said to Moses, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. {2} Be ready in the morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain. {3} No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain.”

{4} So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as YHWH had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands. {5} Then YHWH came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his [[shem|name]], YHWH. {6} And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “YHWH, YHWH, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, {7} maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.”
