{1} “I love You, Lord, my strength.”
{2} The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my savior,
\indent(2) My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge;
\indent(2) My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
{3} I call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised,
\indent(2) And I am saved from my enemies.

{4} The ropes of death encompassed me,
\indent(2) And the torrents of destruction terrified me.
{5} The ropes of Sheol surrounded me;
\indent(2) The snares of death confronted me.
{6} In my distress I called upon the Lord,
\indent(2) And cried to my God for help;
He heard my voice from His temple,
\indent(2) And my cry for help before Him came into His ears.

{7} Then the earth shook and quaked;
\indent(2) And the foundations of the mountains were trembling
\indent(2) And were shaken, because He was angry.
{8} Smoke went up out of His nostrils,
\indent(2) And fire from His mouth was devouring;
\indent(2) Coals burned from it.
{9} He also bowed the heavens down low, and came down
\indent(2) With thick darkness under His feet.
{10} He rode on a cherub and flew;
\indent(2) And He sped on the wings of the wind.
{11} He made darkness His hiding place, His canopy around Him,
\indent(2) Darkness of waters, thick clouds.
{12} From the brightness before Him passed His thick clouds,
\indent(2) Hailstones and coals of fire.
{13} The Lord also thundered in the heavens,
\indent(2) And the Most High uttered His voice,
\indent(2) Hailstones and coals of fire.
{14} He sent out His arrows, and scattered them,
\indent(2) And lightning flashes in abundance, and routed them.
{15} Then the channels of water appeared,
\indent(2) And the foundations of the world were exposed
By Your rebuke, Lord,
\indent(2) At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
