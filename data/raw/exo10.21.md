Even your little ones may go with you.” {25} But Moses said, “You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, so that we may sacrifice them to the Lord our God. {26} Therefore, our livestock too shall go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind, for we shall take some of them to serve the Lord our God. And until we arrive there, we ourselves do not know with what we shall serve the Lord.” {27} But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to let them go. {28} Then Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Be careful, do not see my face again, for on the day you see my face, you shall die!” {29} Moses said, “You have spoken correctly; I shall never see your face again!”
