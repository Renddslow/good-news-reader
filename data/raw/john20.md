{24} But Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. {25} So the other disciples were saying to him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not [[pisteuo|believe]].”

{26} Eight days later His disciples were again inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and said, “Peace be to you.” {27} Then He said to Thomas, “Place your finger here, and see My hands; and take your hand and put it into My side; and do not continue in disbelief, but be a believer.” {28} Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!” {29} Jesus *said to him, “Because you have seen Me, have you now [[pisteuo|believed]]? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet [[pisteuo|believed]].”

{30} So then, many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; {31} but these have been written so that you may [[pisteuo|believe]] that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that by believing you may have [[zoe|life]] in His [[onoma|name]].
