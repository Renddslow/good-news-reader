{15} For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to me: “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand and give it to all the nations to whom I send you, to drink from it. {16} Then they will drink and loudly vomit and act insanely because of the sword that I am going to send among them.”

{17} So I took the cup from the Lord’s hand and gave it to all the nations to whom the Lord sent me, to drink from it: {18} To Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, and its kings and its officials, to make them places of ruins, objects of horror, hissing, and a curse, as it is this day; {19} To Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his officials, and all his people; {20} and to all the foreign people, all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines (that is, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod); {21} To Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon; {22} and to all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastlands which are beyond the sea; {23} and to Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who trim the corners of their hair; {24} and to all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who live in the desert; {25} and to all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media; {26} and to all the kings of the north, near and far, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the earth which are on the face of the ground; and the king of Sheshach shall drink it after them.

{27} “And you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: “Drink, be drunk, vomit, fall down, and do not get up, because of the sword which I am sending among you.”’ {28} And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Lord of armies says: “You shall certainly drink! {29} For behold, I am beginning to inflict disaster on this city which is called by My name, so should you be completely free from punishment? You will not be free from punishment, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth,” declares the Lord of armies.’
