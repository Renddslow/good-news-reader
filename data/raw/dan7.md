{2} Daniel said, “I was looking in my vision by night, and behold, 
the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. {3} And four 
great beasts were coming up from the sea, different from one another. 
{4} The first was like a lion but had the wings of an eagle. I kept 
looking until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from 
the ground and set up on two feet like a man; a human mind also 
was given to it. {5} And behold, another beast, a second one, 
resembling a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three 
ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and they said this to 
it: ‘Arise, devour much meat!’ {6} After this I kept looking, and 
behold, another one, like a leopard, which had on its back four 
wings of a bird; the beast also had four heads, and dominion was 
given to it. {7} After this I kept looking in the night visions, 
and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and extremely 
strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and 
trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different 
from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. {8} 
While I was thinking about the horns, behold, another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the previous horns were plucked out before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes like human eyes, and a mouth uttering great boasts.

{9} “I kept looking
Until thrones were set up,
\indent(2) And the Ancient of Days took His seat;
His garment was white as snow,
\indent(2) And the hair of His head like pure wool.
His throne was ablaze with flames,
\indent(2) Its wheels were a burning fire.
{10} A river of fire was flowing
\indent(2) And coming out from before Him;
Thousands upon thousands were serving Him,
\indent(2) And myriads upon myriads were standing before Him;
The court convened,
\indent(2) And the books were opened.

{11} Then I kept looking because of the sound of the boastful words 
which the horn was speaking; I kept looking until the beast was 
killed, and its body was destroyed and given to the burning fire. 
{12} As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, 
but an extension of life was granted to them for an appointed period of time.

{13} “I kept looking in the night visions,
And behold, with the clouds of heaven
\indent(2) One like a son of man was coming,
And He came up to the Ancient of Days
\indent(2) And was presented before Him.
{14} And to Him was given dominion,
\indent(2) Honor, and a kingdom,
So that all the peoples, nations, and populations of all languages
\indent(2) Might serve Him.
His dominion is an everlasting dominion
\indent(2) Which will not pass away;
And His kingdom is one
\indent(2) Which will not be destroyed.
