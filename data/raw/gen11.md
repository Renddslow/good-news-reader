{1} Now all the earth used the same language and the same words. {2} And it came about, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. {3} Then they said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks and fire them thoroughly.” And they used brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar. {4} And they said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let’s make a [[shem|name]] for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of all the earth.” {5} Now YHWH came down to see the city and the tower which the men had built. {6} And YHWH said, “Behold, they are one people, and they all have the same language. And this is what they have started to do, and now nothing which they plan to do will be impossible for them. {7} Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another’s speech.” {8} So YHWH scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth; and they stopped building the city. {9} Therefore it was [[shem|named]] Babel, because there YHWH confused the language of all the earth; and from there YHWH scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.
