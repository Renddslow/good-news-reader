{1} Now Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the Lord, the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall certainly be neither dew nor rain during these years, except by my word.” {2} Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, {3} “Go away from here and turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan. {4} And it shall be that you will drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to provide food for you there.” {5} So he went and did everything according to the word of the Lord, for he went and lived by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan. {6} And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he would drink from the brook. {7} But it happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
