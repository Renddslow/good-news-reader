{16} So he then handed Him over to them to be crucified.

{17} They took Jesus, therefore, and He went out, carrying His own cross, to the place called the Place of a Skull, which in Hebrew is called, Golgotha. {18} There they crucified Him, and with Him two other men, one on either side, and Jesus in between. {19} Now Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It was written: “JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” {20} Therefore many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and in Greek. {21} So the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews’; rather, write that He said, ‘I am King of the Jews.’” {22} Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”

{23} Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer garments and made four parts: a part to each soldier, and the tunic also; but the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece. {24} So they said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it, to decide whose it shall be.” This happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: “They divided My garments among themselves, and they cast lots for My clothing.” Therefore the soldiers did these things.

{25} Now beside the cross of Jesus stood His mother, His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. {26} So when Jesus saw His mother, and the disciple whom He [[agapao|loved]] standing nearby, He *said to His mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” {27} Then He *said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own household.

{28} After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been accomplished, in order that the Scripture would be fulfilled, *said, “I am thirsty.” {29} A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and brought it up to His mouth. {30} Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, “It is finished!” And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.

{31} Now then, since it was the day of preparation, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews requested of Pilate that their legs be broken, and the bodies be taken away. {32} So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and of the other who was crucified with Him; {33} but after they came to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. {34} Yet one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately [[haima|blood]] and water came out. {35} And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe. {36} For these things took place so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: “Not a bone of Him shall be broken.” {37} And again another Scripture says, “They will look at Him whom they pierced.”
