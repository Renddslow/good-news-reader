{12} For the Lord of armies will have a day of reckoning
\indent(2) Against everyone who is arrogant and haughty,
And against everyone who is lifted up,
\indent(2) That he may be brought low.
{13} And it will be against all the cedars of Lebanon that are lofty and lifted up,
\indent(2) Against all the oaks of Bashan,
{14} Against all the lofty mountains,
\indent(2) Against all the hills that are lifted up,
{15} Against every high tower,
\indent(2) Against every fortified wall,
{16} Against all the ships of Tarshish
\indent(2) And against all the delightful ships.
{17} And the pride of humanity will be humbled
\indent(2) And the arrogance of people will be brought low;
And the Lord alone will be exalted on that day,
\indent(2) {18} And the idols will completely vanish.
{19} People will go into caves of the rocks
\indent(2) And into holes in the ground
Away from the terror of the Lord
\indent(2) And the splendor of His majesty,
\indent(2) When He arises to terrify the earth.
{20} On that day people will throw away to the moles and the bats
Their idols of silver and their idols of gold,
\indent(2) Which they made for themselves to worship,
{21} In order to go into the clefts of the rocks and the crannies of the cliffs
Before the terror of the Lord and the splendor of His majesty,
\indent(2) When He arises to terrify the earth.
