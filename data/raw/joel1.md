{4} What the gnawing locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten;
\indent(2) And what the swarming locust has left, the creeping locust has eaten;
\indent(2) And what the creeping locust has left, the stripping locust has eaten.
{5} Awake, you heavy drinkers, and weep;
\indent(2) And wail, all you wine drinkers,
Because of the sweet wine,
\indent(2) For it has been eliminated from your mouth.
{6} For a nation has invaded my land,
\indent(2) Mighty and without number;
Its teeth are the teeth of a lion,
\indent(2) And it has the jaws of a lioness.
{7} It has made my vine a waste
\indent(2) And my fig tree a stump.
It has stripped them bare and hurled them away;
\indent(2) Their branches have become white.

{8} Wail like a virgin clothed with sackcloth
\indent(2) For the groom of her youth.
{9} The grain offering and the drink offering have been cut off
From the house of the Lord.
\indent(2) The priests mourn,
\indent(2) The ministers of the Lord.
{10} The field is ruined,
\indent(2) The land mourns;
For the grain is ruined,
\indent(2) The new wine has dried up,
\indent(2) Fresh oil has failed.
{11} Be ashamed, you farm workers,
\indent(2) Wail, you vinedressers,
For the wheat and the barley;
\indent(2) Because the harvest of the field is destroyed.
{12} The vine has dried up
\indent(2) And the fig tree has withered;
The pomegranate, the palm also, and the apple tree,
\indent(2) All the trees of the field have dried up.
Indeed, joy has dried up
\indent(2) From the sons of mankind.
